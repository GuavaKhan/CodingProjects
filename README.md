# CodingProjects
This purpose of this repository is to showcase examples of code created by Parker Temple. 
The projects or project snippets shown were written for classes at UC Davis or for personal use.
Please keep in mind that many of these were written while I had full course loads, and so prettiness and readability were sometimes set aside when I needed something functional as a deadline loomed :)
